# CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag Articles and Analysis Methods
This is a repo that contains relevant info regarding CUT&RUN and CUT&Tag computational analysis and interpretation, including protocols, pipelines, peak calling algorithms, benchmarking articles, and applications of these techniques.

## Articles

### CUT&RUN was first described in this article by Pete Skene and Steve Henikoff, published in eLife in 2017:
Peter J Skene & Steven Henikoff. An efficient targeted nuclease strategy for high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites. _eLife_ (2017). https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21856

### This was followed by a detailed protocol for CUT&RUN by Peter Skene et al. in Nature Protocols in 2018:
Peter J Skene, Jorja G Henikoff, & Steven Henikoff. Targeted in situ genome-wide profiling with high efficiency for low cell numbers. _Nature Protocols_ (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2018.015

### autoCUT&RUN was next described by Derek Janssens et al. in Epigenetics & Chromatin in 2018:


### Next came an improvement on the original protocol that expanded antibody compatibility by using pAG-MNase instead of pA-MNase, a salt ion modification to the digestion step, and normalization using the E. coli DNA that is carried over from purification of the MNase enzyme. This was described by Michael Meers et al. in eLife in 2019:
Michael P Meers, Terri D Bryson, Jorja G Henikoff, & Steven Henikoff. Improved CUT&RUN chromatin profiling tools. _eLife_ (2019). https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.46314

### CUT&Tag was first described by Hatice Kaya-Okur in Nature Communications in 2019:
Hatice S. Kaya-Okur, Steven J. Wu, Christine A. Codomo, et al. CUT&Tag for efficient epigenomic profiling of small samples and single cells. _Nat Comm_ (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-09982-5

### A detailed protocol for CUT&Tag was published by Hatice Kaya-Okur in Nature Protocols in 2020:
Hatice S. Kaya-Okur, Derek H. Janssens, Jorja G. Henikoff, Kami Ahmad, & Steven Henikoff. Efficient low-cost chromatin profiling with CUT&Tag. _Nature Protocols_ (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41596-020-0373-x

### Article comparing CUT&Tag peak calling with ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks for K562 cells:
Leyla Abbasova, Paulina Urbanaviciute, Di Hu, Joy N. Ismail, Brian M. Schilder, Alexi Nott, Nathan G. Skene, & Sarah J. Marzi. CUT&Tag recovers up to half of ENCODE ChIP-seq histone acetylation peaks. _Nature Communications_ (2025). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58137-2

### Article benchmarking peak calling methods for CUT&RUN:
